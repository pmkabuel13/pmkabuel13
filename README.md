### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my Name is Mikii, I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering and currently taking my Master's is Energy Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland. I like playing games on my PS5, Switch, and Xbox together with my son, and hanging out with my daughter. I enjoy the weekends with my family, go to church, and drive around the city or nearby towns. I play electric guitar in a band and we play in birthdays and gathering, but nothing too serious.
